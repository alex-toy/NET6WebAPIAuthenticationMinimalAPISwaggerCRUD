# NET 6 Web API Authentication | Minimal API & Swagger (CRUD)

In this project we’ll create a .NET 6 Web API (Minimal API) that will enforce JWT Authentication and Authorization. Furthermore, we’ll add Swagger support and configure Bearer Authentication for it, so that all of our endpoints can be testable from Swagger UI using a bearer token.

We will study the following points :
- How to create a Minimal API project
- Create and use Data Transfer Objects
- Create Services that expose data
- Understand the basics Minimal API in .NET 6
- Setup a CRUD .NET 6 Web API (Minimal API) that will expose services methods
